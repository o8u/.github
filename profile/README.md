**Here are some ideas to get you started:**<br><br>

<p>🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?</p>
<p>🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?</p>
<p>👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?</p>
<p>🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?</p>
<p>🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)</p>
